<h2>My Favourite Books of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzzane Collins</h3>
<p>This is a very political dystopian novel. It covers  so many themes such as poverty and inequality. 
It also discusses the neglect of the greater good that comes with the abusal of power. 
Katniss Everdeen, the main charachter,is my favourite charachter. She is incredibly resilient and strong, while also being incredibly intelligent and caring. 
She sacrifices herself for her sister on multiple accounts. She is also very human. 
She has conflicting love interests which makes her so appealing to teens like myself.</p>
<h3>2.The Divergent Series</h3>
<p>This is another dystopian novel. It is set in a world where people are divided into factions based on their personality and intelligence level.
Trish is the main charachter. When she takes the that recommends which faction she should choose, she realises she is divergent, meaning she does not fit into any one faction. 
Those who are different, or divergent are seen as a threat to the system and so, very few are even aware of their existence, 
divergents are never supposed to discover this fact about themselves, and those who do must be neutralised. Trish is an absolute heroine. 
She like Katniss, intelligent, powerful, knows her own mind, and though at first perhaps a little self serving, will make the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good. 
I think this is a book written for all of those who are different and feel as though they are being hunted all of the time. Shoutout Skittle Squad OGs. </p>
<h3>3. On Silver Tides by Sylvia Bishop</h3>
<p> This is a novel is set on Britain's waterways. It follows Kelda, a teenage Silverman. 
Silvermen are kind of human amphibians. Kelda's sister is born unable to 'go silverside' or breathe underwater.
Silvermen who cannot go silverside, or humans, are referred to as 'Landmen'. 
Landmen living on silvermen boats are outlawed, and there is a wide superstition around the health of the river being directly linked to this particular law. 
Kelda decides to leave her entire life behind in order to protect her sister. Kelda is strong and kind. She makes many large sacrifices for both her sister and,
in fact the entire Silvermen species, even though so many of them are the reason she had to run away with her sister in the first place!  </p>
